# AWS Security Baseline

A comprehensive Terraform-based solution for establishing a security baseline in AWS using native security services. This project provisions essential security monitoring, threat detection, and compliance auditing services to protect your AWS environment.

## üéØ Project Overview

Establishing a robust security baseline is crucial for any cloud deployment. This project automates the deployment of AWS native security services that provide:

- **Comprehensive logging and monitoring** across all AWS regions
- **Threat detection and analysis** using machine learning and behavioral analytics
- **Centralized security findings management** for streamlined security operations
- **Configuration compliance monitoring** to ensure adherence to security best practices
- **Access pattern analysis** to identify potential security risks

The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach ensures consistent, repeatable, and auditable security configurations across your AWS environments.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This project follows Terraform best practices with organized file structure:

```
aws-security-baseline/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf                    # Main resource definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf               # Input variable declarations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs.tf                 # Output value definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ versions.tf                # Terraform and provider versions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ verify_baseline.py         # Python verification script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars.example   # Example variable values
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile                   # Convenience commands
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Project documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore                 # Git ignore patterns
```

### File Organization Benefits

- **main.tf**: Organized by service with clear section headers
- **variables.tf**: Centralized variable definitions with validation
- **outputs.tf**: Comprehensive outputs for service integration
- **versions.tf**: Explicit version constraints for reproducibility

### Data Flow

1. **Event Collection**: CloudTrail captures all API calls and management events across all regions
2. **Configuration Monitoring**: AWS Config continuously monitors resource configurations and compliance
3. **Access Analysis**: IAM Access Analyzer examines resource policies for unintended external access
4. **Threat Detection**: GuardDuty analyzes CloudTrail logs, DNS queries, and network traffic for threats
5. **Centralized Aggregation**: Security Hub collects and correlates findings from all security services
6. **Response & Remediation**: Security teams can respond to findings through Security Hub's centralized interface

## ÔøΩüöÄ How to Use

### Prerequisites

Before deploying this security baseline, ensure you have:

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Terraform >= 1.0 installed
- Python 3.7+ and pip (for the verification script)
- Appropriate AWS permissions for the services being deployed

### Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials

Set up your AWS credentials using one of these methods:

```bash
# Option 1: AWS CLI
aws configure

# Option 2: Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

# Option 3: Use IAM role (if running on EC2)
# No additional configuration needed
```

### Step 2: Initialize and Deploy Terraform

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd aws-security-baseline

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review the planned changes
terraform plan

# Deploy the security baseline
terraform apply
```

**Note**: The deployment may take 5-10 minutes as AWS provisions and configures the security services.

### Step 3: Verify Service Status

Run the Python verification script to confirm all services are properly enabled:

```bash
# Install required Python dependencies
pip install boto3

# Run the verification script
python verify_baseline.py

# For specific region (optional)
python verify_baseline.py --region us-west-2

# Get JSON output for automation (optional)
python verify_baseline.py --json
```

### Step 4: Access Security Services

After successful deployment, you can access the security services through the AWS Console:

- **Security Hub**: [AWS Security Hub Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/)
- **GuardDuty**: [Amazon GuardDuty Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/)
- **CloudTrail**: [AWS CloudTrail Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/)
- **Config**: [AWS Config Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/)
- **Access Analyzer**: [IAM Access Analyzer Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/access-analyzer/)

## üîß Customization

### Variables

You can customize the deployment by modifying variables in `main.tf`:

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  description = "AWS region for resources"
  default     = "us-east-1"  # Change to your preferred region
}

variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment name"
  default     = "production"  # Customize for your environment
}

variable "project_name" {
  description = "Project name for resource naming"
  default     = "my-security-baseline"  # Customize naming
}
```

### Adding Additional Config Rules

You can add more AWS Config rules by adding additional `aws_config_config_rule` resources:

```hcl
resource "aws_config_config_rule" "root_access_key_check" {
  name = "root-access-key-check"

  source {
    owner             = "AWS"
    source_identifier = "ROOT_ACCESS_KEY_CHECK"
  }

  depends_on = [aws_config_configuration_recorder.main]
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

This security baseline incurs costs for:

- **CloudTrail**: Data events and management events
- **GuardDuty**: Per-account and per-GB analyzed
- **Security Hub**: Per finding and per compliance check
- **Config**: Per configuration item and per rule evaluation
- **S3 Storage**: For CloudTrail and Config logs
- **Access Analyzer**: No additional charges

Estimated monthly cost for a small environment: $20-50 USD

## üßπ Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Warning**: This will delete all security monitoring and logs. Ensure you have backups of any important security data.
